# Solana Privacy Hack 2026: The ultimate split tunnel

URnetwork’s mission is to give everyone control of their network. That means the network should be private and work for what people want to do. We have some unique safety rules to make sure everyone can participate without getting a “notice” of doing something wrong, which means sometimes app/websites that require a certain way of working won’t work correctly [1]. Also some of the internet has made a decision to not work if it can’t track your IP (call it the “stateful” internet that wants to track your identity everywhere you go).  

Merging these requirements in a usable way is a challenge for all privacy networks. As part of Solana Privacy Hack 2026 we are releasing an innovating solution that goes farther than any VPN has ever gone with giving people easy choices on whether to route data through URnetwork. This is available on Solana Seeker, Android, iOS, macOS, and all future platforms.

It’s one more reason why URnetwork is the best VPN and also the only fully featured, legitimate VPN that is free for people who contribute. Decentralization is core to our mission, but the end  result is freedom for people to own their network.

How does it work?

- A new quick control panel is available to make routing decisions.
- Traffic that does not pass the security policy will be automatically kept local. A security notification is raised and users can choose to turn off local routing at any time.
- At any time, all of the traffic related to the current app session can be kept local or routed through URnetwork. A notification will show the current status for the current session. If any traffic is kept local, tapping the status will  route all traffic though URnetwork. Otherwise if all traffic is routed through URnetwork, tapping the status will keep all traffic local.

This was developed between Jan 14-30 by the URnetwork team as part of Solana Privacy Hack 2026.
